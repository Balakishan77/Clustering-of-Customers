# Clustering-of-Customers

Acknowledgements: I have taken this E-commerce dataset from Kaggle to practise purpose only If this is against the TOS, please let me know and I will take it down.

Analyzing the content of an E-commerce dataset that lists
purchases made by  4339 customers over a period of one year (from 2010/12/01 to 2011/12/09).
Based on this analysis, I have developed a clustering model that allows to cluster the customers based on their purchases.

Based on the analysis:

Customer Type 1  : These customers like to purchase few products with low price

Customer Type 2  : These customers like to purchase more products with low price

Customer Type 3  : These customers like to purchase few products with high price
